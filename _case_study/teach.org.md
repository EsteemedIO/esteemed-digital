Esteemed Digital was contracted by [Possible.com](http://www.possible.com/), a full-service media agency in Seattle, to consult and implement the second phase of [Teach.org](Teach.org) a website sponsored by Microsoft and other corporate sponsors for the [U.S. Department of Education](http://www.ed.gov/).

The main purpose of the website is to act as a resource for potential future educators. It offers job listings and other social networking opportunities for current students of all ages who might become future teachers.

Esteemed Digital assisted with the integration of the second phase of the site. The site is built using Drupal 7, and was running on Microsoft IIS and SQL. Esteemed Digital recommended a migration to MySQL, and implemented several enhancements such as a custom user dashboard, social log in, custom user profiles, and others.
