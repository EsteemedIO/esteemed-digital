### The Project

[Fuse Ideas](http://www.fuseideas.com/), a Boston-based digital marketing firm with expertise in airport media and other verticals, was in need of Drupal expertise to assist their client San Francisco Airport. Celebrate Drupal was engaged and provided a Technical Lead and management team, as well as back and front end Drupal developers. 

A priority was replacing an outdated Flash-based map with one generated using the airport's own CAD files, paired with a solution created by third-party firm [Jibestream](https://www.jibestream.com/?utm_campaign=AW%20-%20Branded&utm_source=ppc&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIt-O7ndqK2AIVF9NkCh2QugIlEAAYASAAEgLG5PD_BwE), who specializes in interior mapping for shopping malls and hospitals.

### The Solution

No one solution can be cited as there are many projects and sub-projects on-going within this engagement.

#### Maps

The top priority for the airport was mapping. To integrate Jibestream Maps with Drupal 7 the current platform, a custom module was created with PHP that leveraged the Jibestream SDK, Drupal location data for destinations in the airport, and was paired with a custom UI built mainly using Javascript and JQuery. 

#### AWS

Another high priority was the upgrade of the airport's AWS platform and the enhancement of security policies. Our team did a full upgrade of all servers and inventory of any unused creating a significant savings. We also reviewed and recreated all documentation to reflect updates. 

An enhanced workflow was implemented using GitHub instead of Amazon's Beanstalk product for improved flexibility over code reviews, feature branching and code deployments. A strict deployment schedule was also put in place bi-monthly and only in the case of new discoveries in production that needed immediate attention, would this process be overridden.

#### Museum

We had the good fortune of building out a section of the Airport's museum Drupal 7 website '[Video Arts](https://www.flysfo.com/museum/programs/video-arts)' that will feature exhibits from video artists that are cycled throughout the year in the airports theater.
