### The Project

Esteemed Digital was engaged for front-end development services by ING Financial, who was undergoing a brand transition to Voya Financial. The company had both a consumer and corporate site to accommodate with new designs in a new semantic Drupal 7 theme based on the [Mothership Theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/mothership).

### The Solution

Esteemed Digital worked with a large team of developers to quickly transform the two sites to feature the new brand working from comps and using the [Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs) module. This unique content creation contributed module added to the semantic nature of the project's HTML output, as opposed to what might be found on a traditional Drupal website.
