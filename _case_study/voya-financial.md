Voya Financial is a Fortune 500 financial organization headquartered in New York, NY, offering retirement, investment, and insurance resources to more than 14 million Americans. Voya began as “ING Financial,” a subsidiary of ING Group, but after securing independent financial backing, underwent a complete brand transition and became what is now known as Voya Financial.

The mission at Voya is to “make a secure financial future possible — one person, one family, \[and\] one institution at a time \[—\] while being equally committed to conducting business in a way that is socially, environmentally, economically, and ethically responsible.”

### The Challenge

Voya offers web services to individuals, employers, financial professionals, and institutional investors. The organization was undergoing a brand transition and therefore required an overhaul of both their consumer and corporate website to accommodate the shifting design and messaging in-line with their brand.

Voya required technical expertise that could assist with updating their sites with a new semantic Drupal theme.

### The Solution

Esteemed Digital provided a senior consultant, a Senior Front End Drupal Developer, who worked with a large team of talented developers to quickly transform the two sites. Working from Voya’s comps (mock-ups of the proposed web design) and using Drupal’s [Paragraphs module](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs), the solution featured the new Voya brand exactly as requested. This unique content creation module gave the team the ability to build cleaner code and grant more editing power to Voya’s end-users. The choice added to the semantic nature of the project's HTML output (as opposed to what might be found on a traditional Drupal website).

The solution was featured as [one of the most famous Drupal sites](https://www.educowebdesign.com/blog/insights/drupal-sites-51-examples-popular-sites-using-drupal) in an article by a third-party source, which assessed Drupal sites built for corporations, financial companies, universities, media groups, healthcare organizations, and more. Esteemed Digital’s work with Voya Financials ranks 10th on the list, joining names like Nasdaq, Whole Foods, Tesla, NASA, and General Electric.

Voya Financial turned to Esteemed Digital’s talented Drupal developers to realize their vision.
