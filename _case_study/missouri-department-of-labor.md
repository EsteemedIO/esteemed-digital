### The Project

Esteemed Digital was contracted by Information Resources Group to serve their government client The Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. Working with both IRG Project Management and DOLIR Communications, Esteemed Digital led the 9 month project, providing Drupal development, architecture, and technical project management services.

### The Solution

The project consisted of rolling out a total redesign and migration to Drupal 7 from ASP for the State of Missouri's Labor & Industrial Relations website. The work included migrating several thousand static HTML files, as well as 20,000 PDF forms and publications. The team also recreated approximately 30 JavaScript forms and functions from the legacy website. The site [www.labor.mo.gov](http://www.labor.mo.gov/) is responsive, built using a custom version of Omega theme.
