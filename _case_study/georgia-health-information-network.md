### The Project

Esteemed Digital was contracted by [SapientNitro](http://sapientnitro.com/) to consult and implement improvements to the graphic and information architectural elements of the State of Georgia's Department of Health website [Georgia Health Information Network](http://gahin.org/).

### The Solution

The site acts as a portal for the State's health information records which offer providers, and patients, all medical record information in a central source. It is built using Drupal 7.
