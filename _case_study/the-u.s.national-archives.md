Esteemed Digital was retained by Viderity Inc. to act as a Drupal Architects for their client The National Archives. Esteemed Digital was tasked with providing architecture and cloud hosting expertise.

A comprehensive migration and test plan was created to provide a road map for relocating the agency's flagship website [archives.gov](archives.gov) to the Amazon Cloud Hosting platform (AWS). This, as well as the agency's intranet site, all with redundant backup. 

A key goal of the operation was insuring the site adheres to the agency's 100% up-time standards. In addition to the migration, Esteemed Digital consulted on the upgrade procedures for archives.gov to move from Drupal version 6 to 7.
